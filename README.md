# SkyPredators

**Production client website designed, built, and deployed end-to-end on AWS.**

This is a live business website that I fully designed and developed, including UI/UX, content creation, media, and cloud infrastructure setup.

## Live Site
https://www.skypredators.com/

## Tech Stack
- Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Hosting & Infrastructure: AWS EC2, AWS S3
- Security: AWS security groups, HTTPS configuration
- Media: Custom intro video montage

## What I Built
- Designed and implemented a fully responsive website from scratch
- Migrated the site from GoDaddy hosting to AWS
- Configured AWS EC2 and S3 for production hosting
- Set up security groups and server configuration to safely expose the site
- Created and embedded a custom promotional video montage
- Deployed, tested, and maintained the live production site

## Highlights
- Full ownership of a real production deployment
- Hands-on experience with AWS infrastructure and hosting migration
- Direct collaboration with a real client from concept to launch
